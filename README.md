# UEWebSocket
Open Source C++ and Blueprint WebSocket Plugin upgraded for use with Unreal Engine 4.26.1.

#### I have older projects with older engine versions that were using this plugin, but there were some game-breaking bugs recently introduced in 4.26.1, one specifically was the change with UClass and FFieldClass.  This is the working source for a websocket c++ & blueprint plugin with bug fixes that compiles & is now usable with Unreal Engine 4.26.1.

#### Now the [UE WebSocket Client](https://www.ue4community.wiki/websocket-client-cpp-5vk7hp9e) is available and easy to implement, but I upgraded my previous C++ codebase for a project that was using this plugin. I noticed the plugin was no longer maintained or available, so I wanted to upload my source for 4.26.1 in case anyone else is/was in need of it that was using the plugin for older projects.
