# UEWebSocket
Open Source C++ and Blueprint WebSocket Plugin upgraded for use with Unreal Engine 4.26.1.

#### I have older projects with older engine versions that were using this plugin, but there were some game-breaking bugs recently introduced in 4.26.1, one specifically was the change with UClass and FFieldClass.  This is the working source for a websocket c++ & blueprint plugin with bug fixes that compiles & is now usable with Unreal Engine 4.26.1.
